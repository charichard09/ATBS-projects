#  Program that mimics Pascal's Triangle formula. In Pascal's Triangle, each cell is the sum of the number, or numbers, directly above it.
#  Given an integer for number of rows (1 <= numRows <= 30), return the values for each cell in each row from top to bottom  
#  (i.e. numRows = 5, return [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]])

number_rows = input("Please enter between 1 and 30 how many rows to calculate for Pascal's Triangle:\n")
